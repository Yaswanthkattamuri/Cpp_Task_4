Tasks

Task 1: Working with STL Algorithms

This task practices the following algorithms:

std::for_each: Iterate through all controls and print their details.

std::find: Find a control with a specific ID.

std::find_if: Find the first control that is invisible.

std::adjacent_find: Find consecutive controls with the same state.

std::count: Count the number of visible controls.

std::count_if: Count the number of disabled sliders.

std::equal: Compare subranges of controls.

Task 2: Iterating Through Containers and Finding Elements

Print all dynamic widgets using an iterator (from a vector).

Search for a specific widget (like "WarningLights") in a set.

Combine two containers (vector and set) and search for widgets in the combined container.

Task 3: Advanced STL Operations

Use algorithms like std::copy, std::fill, std::generate, std::transform, std::replace, and std::remove_if to manipulate the control states.

Reverse the order of controls and partition them based on visibility.
